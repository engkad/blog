Engineering vs true stress-strain

LRFD/LSD vs ASD
Allowable Strength Design (ASD): Calculate/simulate nominal loads/stresses and compare to an “allowable strength” defined by the yield/ultimate strength divided by a safety factor $\Omega$. This is a simple and intuitive method and common safety factors are 3/4; 3 to yield and 4 to ultimate, whichever results in lower allowable strength. Alternative SF e.g. 2/3 used for extreme load cases like hurricane etc.
Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) or Limit State Design (LSD): Used in structural engineering and can get very complex. Works better when looking at ductile post-yield behavior and nonlinear analysis since safety factor placed on loads and material strength based on type of loading and type of failure. E.g. dead load (predictable) has small factor applied to it but wind loading (more variable) has a larger factor. Similarly, failure due to tensile stress has a smaller knockdown than buckling following the same reasoning. LRFD lets you get more detailed with what safety factors you put on which loads rather than a blanket safety factor which can be overconservative. LRFD is also backed by extensive empirical data to inform the factors and design safe but not overconservative ($$$) structures.">

Alternatively use slugs. $$ g_c = 32.174\\ \\frac{\\text{lbm}\\cdot\\text{ft}}{\\text{lbf}\\cdot\\text{s}^2} $$ Convince yourself this makes sense by trying $$ F = m \\cdot g $$ where F is in lbf, m is in lbm, and g is in ft/s^2. 1 lbm should weigh 1 lbf so you need to divide out the magnitude of g and cancel out the units respectively.\nSCFM Not a volumetric flow, really just a mass flow. The “Standard” in the name means it is a volume flow at a standardized temperature and pressure, which means the density of the working fluid is defined and thus it is a mass flow. For many fluids applications this is 59°F and 14.7psia, and to convert from lb/s to SCFM you do the following: $$ \\dot{m}\\ [\\text{SCFM}] = \\frac{\\dot{m}\\ [\\frac{\\text{lbm}}{\\text{s}}]}{\\rho\\ (\\text{T=59°F*,\\ P=14.7 psia*})\\ [\\frac{\\text{lbm}}{\\text{ft}^3}]}\\times \\frac{60\\ [\\text{s}]}{1\\ [\\text{m}]} $$ *ensure these conditions are consistent\nYouTube videos Engine cycles\nEngine ignition\nEngine cooling\nEfficient Engineer MoM playlist\nRandom tools Relief valve sizing See API520\nO-ring seals Parker O-ring selector/groove calculator (handbook)\nCompression See handbook’s compression values for the durometer, then use those values to calculate clamp force of the bolts you’re using.

<p><strong>Allowable Strength Design (ASD):</strong> Calculate/simulate nominal loads/stresses and compare to an “allowable strength” defined by the yield/ultimate strength divided by a safety factor $\Omega$. This is a simple and intuitive method and common safety factors are 3/4; 3 to yield and 4 to ultimate, whichever results in lower allowable strength. Alternative SF e.g. 2/3 used for extreme load cases like hurricane etc.<br>
<strong>Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) or Limit State Design (LSD):</strong> Used in structural engineering and can get very complex. Works better when looking at ductile post-yield behavior and nonlinear analysis since safety factor placed on loads and material strength based on type of loading and type of failure. E.g. dead load (predictable) has small factor applied to it but wind loading (more variable) has a larger factor. Similarly, failure due to tensile stress has a smaller knockdown than buckling following the same reasoning. LRFD lets you get more detailed with what safety factors you put on which loads rather than a blanket safety factor which can be overconservative. LRFD is also backed by extensive empirical data to inform the factors and design safe but not overconservative ($$$) structures.</p>

Incompressible flow assumes small change in density ~&lt;5%, which correlates to M~=0.3. It's a good starting point but be sure to check your change in density and determine if the assumption was valid or not.

<p><strong>Not</strong> a volumetric flow, really just a mass flow. The &ldquo;<strong>S</strong>tandard&rdquo; in the name means it is a volume flow at a standardized temperature and pressure, which means the density of the working fluid is defined and thus it is a mass flow. For many fluids applications this is 59°F and 14.7psia, and to convert from lb/s to SCFM you do the following:
</p>
$$
\dot{m}\ [\text{SCFM}] = \frac{\dot{m}\ [\frac{\text{lbm}}{\text{s}}]}{\rho\ (\text{T=59°F*,\ P=14.7 psia*})\ [\frac{\text{lbm}}{\text{ft}^3}]}\times \frac{60\ [\text{s}]}{1\ [\text{m}]}
