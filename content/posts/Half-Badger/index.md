# Introduction
Half-Badger is a liquid rocket designed to compete in the FAR-OUT liquid/hybrid rocket competition in Mojave, CA.

# Propulsion Engineering
Most of my efforts contributed to the propulsion and fluid system that fell under the responsibility of the Propulsion sub-team, for which I was a co-lead. I was also heavily involved test stand design and test operations, including co-founding a committee to develop a permanent propulsion test facility at UW-Madison.
