A collection of interview questions I've come across and like to share and discuss with other engineers.

## Structural
<details>
<summary><strong></strong></summary>


</details>

## Material Behavior
<details>
<summary><strong>How do you go between stress and strain in a material?</strong></summary>

Hooke's Law in elastic region of material,
$$
\sigma = E \varepsilon
$$
where \(E\) is the Young's modulus or modulus of elasticity.
</details>

## Fluid Systems

## Propulsion

## Behavioral
<details>
<summary><strong>What was a time where you couldn't meet a deadline, and how did you communicate that and deal with it?</strong></summary>

(subjective)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is an example of a professional failure that you've had, and what did you take away from it?</strong></summary>

My example was a COTS component that failed on our Spaceport 2024 rocket, and from that I learned not to trust a component that I don't fully understand the mechanism of; I didn't realize the eye bolt was only partially threaded, etc.
</details>

## Random
<details>
<summary><strong>How much paint does it take to paint a Falcon 9? (whatever units, give your best guess)</strong></summary>

Having just seen a falcon 9 in person helps. My guess for approximate dimensions were 10ft diameter and 100ft tall. Thus approximately 30ft circumference times 100ft length is 3000ft^2. From painting walls I guessed it takes (very roughly) around 1 gallon to paint a 10ft x 10ft wall (so 100ft^2), so 3000/100 = 30 gallons of paint. Actual answer is around 40 gallons!
