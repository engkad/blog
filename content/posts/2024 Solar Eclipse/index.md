Stayed in Bloomington, IL the night before in a questionable cheap hotel 🤨 but the eclipse was worth it. Ended up in a cute small town called Marshall with lots of grassy space.

I used my Canon EOS T3i with the EF-S 55-250 IS STM and a custom-made solar filter using aluminized mylar for non-eclipsed pictures.
