# The author
Hello! I'm an aerospace engineer from Madison, WI. I got my B.S. in Engineering Mechanics and Aerospace from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in spring 2025, and now work as a propulsion test engineer.

I was part of the Wisconsin Space Program student org for my entire time in undergrad and continue to help and advise where I can. Key projects I've been involved in include:
- Research, development, analysis and test of a 1000lbf isopropanol/LOX rocket engine  
- Design, assembly, and hot fire testing of a GCH4/GOX torch igniter  
- Leading UW's first team to attend the Spaceport America Cup intercollegiate rocket competition  
- Advising our second team at Spaceport where we won 2nd place in Payload  
  
As an undergrad at UW-Madison I've worked in a number of positions:  
- Research assistant at Wisconsin Shock Tube Laboratory (WiSTL)  
- Research assistant at Andrews Electronics Laboratory (LPES)  
- Tutor & PrEPS facilitator at Undergraduate Learning Center (ULC)
