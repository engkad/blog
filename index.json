At the base where it is fixed, at both the top and bottom of the cross-section.\nIs the stress tensile or compressive? Tensile at the top of the beam and compressive at the bottom.\nHow do you know if it will fail completely? Ultimate tensile strength since it will be lower than ultimate compressive strength.\nWhat is the ideal shape of the beam (to prevent failure) and why? A cross-section with a high moment of inertia to distribute the stress better such as an I-beam, since the equation for stress due to bending is: $$ \\sigma = \\frac{My}{I} $$ Given a cylindrical pressure vessel with spherical ends: If you are pressure testing it, where do you place the crack (cylinder or end cap) and in what orientation (longitudinally or perpendicularly)? Along longitudinal axis so it propagates along hoop stress, that is the hoop stress failure mode. If you were to grind that crack out into a divot, how to know if it's still safe to use? Check hand calculations with reduced thickness/stress concentration and see if it is still allowable.\nIf your hand calcs say it yields, how to know if we can still use it? Can look at local yielding to redistribute stress with hand calcs or FEA.\nYou’re given a metallic bracket from a rocket, and your boss asks you to figure out if it’s going to break. What questions are you asking? What material is it made from (to get properties)? What loads is it under? What are the specifics of the geometry? Your boss tells you it’s made of 15-5 stainless and gives you the loads. What do you do next to find out if it breaks? Start with basic hand calculations like bending and stress analysis Possibly build an FEA model, but verify the FEA with hand calcs What kind of failure would you expect in a long slender beam? Buckling\nWhat are the important factors in tendency to buckle? Consider Euler buckling and critical load: $$ P_{\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2} $$ Boundary conditions (affects K value, fixed-fixed will be a lot stronger (lower K) than pinned-free) Length of beam (similarly slenderness ratio, ratio of length to radius) Stiffness of beam How do longitudinal and hoop stresses differ, and which one fails first? Hoop stress acts circumferentially and is typically twice as large as longitudinal stress in thin-walled pressure vessels. Longitudinal stress acts along the length of the vessel. Hoop stress usually causes failure first due to its higher magnitude. General Solids/Fluids Behavior How do you go between stress and strain in a material? Hooke\u0026rsquo;s Law in elastic region of material, $$ \\sigma = E \\varepsilon $$ where \\(E\\) is the Young\u0026rsquo;s modulus or modulus of elasticity.\nExplain what Reynolds number is and what it tells you. Reynolds number is a dimensionless value that helps predict whether a flow is likely to be laminar or turbulent. It’s not an absolute threshold, but a strong indicator of flow regime tendency. How do cryogenic fluids affect metals? Yield strength and ultimate strength both generally increase for stainless steels at cryogenic temperatures. For other metals (heavy generalization) strength may increase but ductility decreases, making metals behave more brittle. Some metals exhibit a brittle transition temperature below which brittleness dominates Thermal contraction and expansion cause dimensional changes and stresses. Thermal conductivity of metals can change at cryogenic temperatures (e.g., copper shows increased conductivity). What is the volume ratio for vaporizing fluids, and why is it important? Typically between 800 and 1900. Helps illustrate the immense change in volume when a fluid changes phase and the potential energy contained (such as in a BLEVE event) Fluid Systems You have an orifice in an incompressible fluid system. What happens to the pressure drop when you double the mass flow rate? What about for incompressible? Why are they different? 4x, 2x, density\nWhat considerations go into developing a LOX fluid system? No trapped fluid: burst disks, relief valves, ball valves with holes, etc Material selection: lots of stainless, PTFE instead of rubber (LOX-compatible) Temperature effects: freezing control devices What are the main differences between a pneumatic system versus a hydraulic or electromechanical system? Hydraulic systems provide higher force output due to incompressible fluid. Hydraulics are more precise because the fluid is incompressible. Hydraulic systems have shorter time constants (faster response). Pneumatics use compressible air, typically less precise and lower force. Electromechanical systems rely on motors and actuators, often simpler but with different force/response characteristics. What are the main differences between a conventional valve and a cryogenic valve? Different sealing materials designed to withstand cryogenic temperatures Cryogenic-compatible materials like stainless (often oxygen compatible too) Features such as hole in the ball valve to prevent trapped cryogenic fluid Propulsion If you double the mass flow rate in an engine, how does chamber pressure change? How does thrust change? Chamber pressure doubles (PUT EQN) Thrust doubles (put eqn)\nWhat's the difference between low cycle and high cycle fatigue? What are some examples of both in a rocket engine? What is the primary factor that drives tank pressure on a pressure fed rocket engine? Pump cavitation - suction pressure\nGiven isentropic flow through a CD nozzle: How does static pressure change through the nozzle? Decreases in the converging section and decreases further in the diverging section. What happens if the exit pressure is too high or too low? Overexpanded: exit pressure is too low compared to ambient → potential for flow separation. Underexpanded: exit pressure is too high → less efficient expansion. How does stagnation pressure change through the nozzle? It stays constant in ideal isentropic flow. How does Mach number change through the nozzle? Starts low, reaches Mach 1 at the throat, and increases to high supersonic values (e.g., Mach 5 or 6) in the diverging section. How does temperature change through the nozzle? Temperature decreases in the converging section and drops significantly in the diverging section. Explain the thermodynamic cycle of a full-flow staged combustion engine like Raptor. Explain what goes where and why.\nDo you tap off the fuel and oxidizer for preburners before or after the main pumps? After!\nWhat are the key advantages of using a full-flow staged combustion cycle over other cycles like gas-generator or expander? Less waste heat because all propellant flows through turbines and combustors. More efficient combustion in the main combustion chamber. How do you calculate the specific impulse (Isp) of a rocket engine? What factors influence it? Specific impulse is calculated as thrust divided by propellant weight flow rate:\n$$ I_{sp} = \\frac{F}{\\dot{m} g_0} $$ Factors influencing Isp include chamber pressure, nozzle expansion ratio, propellant type, and combustion efficiency. What happens if you shorten the combustion chamber? Shortening the CC can reduce combustion efficiency and completeness. It may lead to increased combustion instability or incomplete burning. Both of these can reduce overall engine performance and specific impulse. Compare a single shaft and dual shaft closed cycle engine. Single shaft:\nSimple design, lower cost and weight Might not have enough power to drive both pumps Coupled power control between fuel and oxidizer pumps More complex leak considerations due to shared shaft Dual shaft:\nIndependent power control of fuel and oxidizer pumps Can deliver more power overall Heavier and more expensive design Requires more seals and complexity Design and Manufacturing What’s the difference between MMC and LMC in GD\u0026T? - MMC (Maximum Material Condition): part contains the most material (smallest hole, largest pin) - LMC (Least Material Condition):part contains the least material (largest hole, smallest pin) They affect how much geometric tolerance is allowed based on feature size. - What are basic dimensions used for in GD\u0026T? Basic dimensions define the exact theoretical location, size, or orientation of a feature. They are used in conjunction with geometric tolerances but are not themselves toleranced. Behavioral What was a time where you couldn't meet a deadline, and how did you communicate that and deal with it? (subjective)\nWhat is an example of a professional failure that you've had, and what did you take away from it? My example was a COTS component that failed on our Spaceport 2024 rocket, and from that I learned not to trust a component that I don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand the mechanism of; I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize the eye bolt was only partially threaded, etc.\nWhat's a technical decision that you regret? (subjective)\nWhat is an important piece of engineering feedback you’ve received? e.g. club industry advisor raised concerns about N₂O system risk. He encouraged stepping back because we didn’t fully understand the fluid behavior and potential hazards. That feedback reinforced the importance of not rushing into implementation without a full systems-level understanding. Random How much paint does it take to paint a Falcon 9? (whatever units, give your best guess) Having just seen a falcon 9 in person helps. My guess for approximate dimensions were 10ft diameter and 100ft tall. Thus approximately 30ft circumference times 100ft length is 3000ft^2. From painting walls I guessed it takes (very roughly) around 1 gallon to paint a 10ft x 10ft wall (so 100ft^2), so 3000/100 = 30 gallons of paint. Actual answer is around 40 gallons!\n","permalink":"https://kyleadler.com/posts/interview-questions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA collection of interview questions I\u0026rsquo;ve come across and like to share and discuss with other engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"structural\"\u003eStructural\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGiven a fixed-free cantilever beam in bending (load at the free end):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is the highest stress?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the base where it is fixed, at both the top and bottom of the cross-section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs the stress tensile or compressive?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTensile at the top of the beam and compressive at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you know if it will fail completely?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/summary\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimate tensile strength since it will be lower than ultimate compressive strength.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Interview Questions"},{"content":"Link to solver\nPurpose use the code i made in ema524 with jackson\n","permalink":"https://kyleadler.com/posts/rocket_py/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://py.engrkad.com/rocket\"\u003eLink to solver\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"purpose\"\u003ePurpose\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euse the code i made in ema524 with jackson\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Python Rocket Solver"},{"content":"Earlier this week I had the chance to chat about the Wisconsin Space Program student org and our goals to take Wisconsin past the Karman line on WSUM 91.7 FM Madison\u0026rsquo;s Space Case segment.

There are a number of categories and it takes place outside of Las Cruces in southern New Mexico.\nWisconsin Space Program UW Madison\u0026rsquo;s aerospace org has participated in a number of rocket competitions before including Argonia Cup (Argonia, KS) and MRL (Midwest Rocket Launch). Previous teams have applied, but 2023 was the first year we were accepted into the competition.\nThe Process We designed the rocket ourselves specifically for this competition, and it was constructed with mostly COTS components (fiberglass tubes, motor casing, hardware, etc.) and a few Student Researched And Developed (SRAD) parts, such as custom waterjet-cut fiberglass fins with fiberglass/epoxy layup, and custom CNC-routed plywood bulkheads.\n(CONSTRUCTION PHOTOS)\nAs Team Lead for this project and President of the student org at the time, I was in charge of most of the design and construction of the rocket, and oversaw all subsystems such as avionics and payload. This also included intitial development of a radio telemetry system, the code for which can be found on the github repository below.\nhttps://github.com/aiaauwmadison/spaceport-avionics\nTest Flight In May, we completed construction of the rocket and performed a test launch at a local launch site in IL. In place of our in-development payload, we used jars of peanut butter as ballast (my high school team found out that large peanut butter jars fit perfectly in 4\u0026quot; fiberglass tubing, later that year we also found out what burnt peanut butter and fiberglass smell like after a motor CATO - would not recommend!). The test flight went great and we were set for finishing touches like a fancy paintjob and finalizing development of payload/avionics.\n(IMAGE OF PEANUT BUTTER JAR)\nUW College of Engineering Support This competition would not have been possible without the support from UW Departments of Engineering Physics and Mechanical Engineering.
