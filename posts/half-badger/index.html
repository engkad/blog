I was also heavily involved test stand design and test operations, including co-founding a committee to develop a permanent propulsion test facility at UW-Madison.\nSystem Design Comments Competition Why FAR-OUT? FAR-OUT is the first competition dedicated to liquid and hybrid rockets. This means it has much more to offer when it comes to expertise and advising of liquid propulsion systems than Spaceport, which has only had 1 team attempt liquids.\nHow is it scored A number of factors go into the scoring, primarily how close you are to your predicted apogee, and how good your mass fractions and engine efficiency (Isp) are.\nWhy 15k ft altitude target? 15k was a good target for us since it’s the upper bound of the lowest category.\nWhy build a liquid rocket? Building a liquid rocket offers an incredible opportunity for students to get hands-on experience that is directly applicable to the aerospace industry.\nTCA Material Selection Aluminum (6061-T6)\n3x lighter than 316 but 3x lower yield and ultimate strength bad oxygen compatibility unless coated (adds complexity) great manufacturability selected for IPA fuel tank and some structural members Stainless steel (316/316L)\nbest oxygen/corrosion compatibility maintains good strength at high temperatures decent manufacturability tensile strength increases significantly at cryogenic temperatures chosen for TCA and LOX tank Copper alloy\ngood oxygen/corrosion compatibility best thermal conductivity (~10x 316, higher for cryogenic temps) \u003e3x more expensive than stainless around half the tensile strength so still doesn’t perform as well in thermal transient sim, would need to design differently to take advantage of conductivity (regen) Inconel\ngreat oxygen/corrosion compatibility excellent strength at high temps very difficult manufacturing very expensive would be good for reinforcing critical areas Propulsion Parameters Mixture ratio=1.0\ngood compromise between combustion temperature and isp, could go higher with more sophisticated cooling methods using stainless steel melting point: used as a starting point, since a higher combustion temperature could be tolerated with more film cooling. We were planning on some iteration with film cooling calcs but 10% isn’t too much or too little so we stuck with it Chamber pressure=500 psi\ngood compromise between tank pressure requirements (tank thickness and ability to pressure test to 1.5x) and throat area (which dictates exit diameter through expansion ratio) throat area determined with CEA and thrust coefficient equation Nozzle design\nrao parabolic offers close to ideal performance, chose lower end of 80% bell length (nearly 98.5% ideal) since this small of an engine with our tolerances likely won’t benefit from any better Film cooling\nchose 10% as a good starting point used by other engines in industry 1D numerical simulation for the film cooling showed 10% would be sufficient not confident in some of the assumptions made in the analysis, so decided to test with some TCs to verify and improve model for further designs since we can’t know the exact behavior occurring in the chamber, we had two options: attempt two-phase compressible CFD with combustion (not feasible with our resources as a student group) start with a rough (theoretically conservative) estimate from our analysis, and then validate analysis parameters through testing Burn time = 5s\noriginally 7.5s with a the old n2o engine design, but with higher combustion temperature we needed a lower burn time to take advantage of transient, also less burn time since larger thrust Vehicle diameter and length\nmatch similar rockets we’ve built, diameter is sufficient for a our desired expansion with reasonable chamber pressure Tank pressure\nadded up pressure drops along tubing and flow components (valves, cav, tees, etc) Propellants The initial oxidizer selected was saturated nitrous oxide (N2O) as used on HalfCat Sphinx, however nitrous has a number of drawbacks to it:\nSaturated N2O is stored at very high pressures (~600-1000psi depending on temperature), which means a very high risk of BLEVE event Two-phase flow is extremely hard to characterize and measure, which goes against our goals of trying to measure and learn as much as we can from this engine Risk of cavitation from pressure drop -\u003e bubble collapse combined with organic contamination (“dieseling”) can cause detonation in fluid line And we instead chose to use cryogenic liquid oxygen as our oxidizer, which also carries significant risks and required safety protocols, but has the advantages of:\nIndustry-standard oxidizer, excellent learning opportunity for cryogenics and oxygen safety procedures/considerations that are directly applicable to industry Much better engine performance, ~20% better Isp than N2O for our chamber pressure and expansion ratio Also higher Isp for the same combustion temperature As far as our fuel selection goes, we decided on the alcohols isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol for the following reasons:\nVery similar performance to other hydrocarbons like kerosene Both IPA and ethanol have lower freezing points than kerosene, less risk of freezing near cryogenic fluid system Both are very cheap and easy to source, IPA slightly moreso but very slightly lower performance The pressurant was decided to be nitrogen due to cost\nN2 Cheap Slightly worse performing than helium Could potentially condense in a lox tank, this can be mitigated by diffusers and minimizing turbulence and mixing in the tankj Lower gamma so less joule thompson cooling He ~5x more expensive than N2 Helium has much higher kinematic viscosity, so much lower reynolds number -\u003e less pressure losses Lower density, so less pressurant mass needed to fill the same amount of volume Injector Significant guidance for design of the injector was provided by RPE9 and Huzel \u0026 Huang. A like-unlike impinging injector was chosen for simplicity of design, manufacturability, and performance. Since this engine uses liquid injection, an incompressible discharge coefficient flow equation was used to calculate required injection area for the fuel and oxidizer, which is then used to find the number and size of orifices (the size of orifices was chosen to be compatible with available tooling). $$ \\dot{m} = Q\\rho = C_d A \\sqrt{2\\rho \\Delta P} $$ The impingement distance is a relevant parameter but not a major design consideration. Instead of focusing on a precise value, it should be chosen to be as close to the injector face as heat transfer, mixing efficiency and manufacturing permit.\nCombustion Chamber The combustion chamber size is best characterized by the parameter characteristic chamber length \\(L^*\\). Defined as the ratio of chamber volume to nozzle throat area, \\(L^*\\) specifies the propellant stay time in the combustion chamber. While \\(L^*\\) increases the characteristic performance of a combustion chamber up to a certain point (as the propellant has more time to react completely), beyond this, larger values lead to higher chamber volume and weight, increased cooling surface area, and greater friction losses. In industry, optimization analysis is required to determine the minimum \\(L^*\\) for efficient combustion, with experimental firings used to validate this under specific conditions. An estimate from existing experimental data can be a good approximate value however, and can be obtained from Huzel \u0026 Huang based on the chosen propellant combination.\nNozzle The purpose of the nozzle is to extract enthalpy from the combustion products and turn it into kinetic energy. An ideally expanded nozzle will accelerate the products to sonic at the throat, and accelerate supersonically until the nozzle exit pressure matches atmospheric pressure.\nThe nozzle geometry was constructed using a Rao parabolic approximation which approximates an ideal nozzle shape. The length of this nozzle is based off of the percent length of a full bell nozzle, and an 80% length nozzle results in over 98% ideal efficiency. Rao then provides a function for the contour of the nozzle which can be modeled in CAD and machined using a CNC lathe.\nThe thickness of the nozzle was determined first by estimating a value suitable for the pressures experienced, then thickened in high-heat flux areas such as the converging section and throat.\nTCA Sealing PTFE o-rings used to seal between LOX and IPA manifold grooves FKM o-rings used to seal between IPA manifold groove and atmosphere Graphite pipe gaskets (cut to size with waterjet) used to seal between injector face and combustion chamber High temperature requirement Bolt pretension selected to maintain adequate sealing force for o-rings and gasket while running Fluid System Tanks Initially, our design for the tank was modeled off of HalfCat Rocketry’s Sphinx rocket, using saturated nitrous oxide as the oxidizer, which autogeneously pressurizes itself, and through the use of a stacked piston tank, the fuel (isopropyl alcohol) as well.\nThis design as some flaws however. Since cavitating venturis are not used in N2O systems (since it would immediately cavitate which is dangerous in nitrous), the flow is not very decoupled from the combustion chamber. This is not necessarily an issue, but combined with the fact that N2O-IPA combustion in the Sphinx design is very unstable (verified c* efficiencies of ~70%), this means that the very stiff injector (over 50%) is absolutely necessary to maintain semi-stable combustion, and may not adequately decouple instability that could excite a natural frequency of the feedline and piston tank (which could be particularly susceptible since the floating piston is coupled to propellant pressures).\nFor these and several other reasons, we decided to change our oxidizer to cryogenic liquid oxygen, and instead use a separate nitrogen pressurant tank to pressurize the independent LOX and IPA tanks.\nFluids Routing Plumbing and Instrumentation Diagram (P\u0026ID) for the test stand setup Test Operations TBD\nRegrettable decisions Administrative/timeline\nNot building prototypes sooner could’ve machined injector out of aluminum, forcing us to practice CAM on aluminum while also having a test article to validate discharge coefficients with Not leak testing more sections of line prior to water flow test Fluid system\nNPT requires tons of thread tape and space to twist, swagelok is really expensive could’ve used more AN flared fittings Forgot to put zero thrust tees on vent valves - venting can be a lot of thrust! Tubing for PTs should be as small as possible to minimize volume, 1/8\" or something. Can still have length to prevent cryo temps Need faster acting valves, 1s is too slow Purge line needs an orifice to be lower pressure for ox side since purging during startup; don’t want to stop lox flow Need tubes to carry vent/dump LOX away from test stand TCA\nforgot to put PT/TC in injector manifold Manifold pressures/temperatures are going to be your best indicators of propellant ended up putting a tee into the inlet lines, this works fine too ",

<h5 id="propellants">Propellants<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#propellants">#</a></h5>
<p>The initial oxidizer selected was saturated nitrous oxide (N2O) as used on HalfCat Sphinx, however nitrous has a number of drawbacks to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturated N2O is stored at very high pressures (~600-1000psi depending on temperature), which means a very high risk of BLEVE event</li>
<li>Two-phase flow is extremely hard to characterize and measure, which goes against our goals of trying to measure and learn as much as we can from this engine</li>
<li>Risk of cavitation from pressure drop -&gt; bubble collapse combined with organic contamination (&ldquo;dieseling&rdquo;) can cause detonation in fluid line</li>
</ul>
<p>And we instead chose to use cryogenic liquid oxygen as our oxidizer, which also carries significant risks and required safety protocols, but has the advantages of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry-standard oxidizer, excellent learning opportunity for cryogenics and oxygen safety procedures/considerations that are directly applicable to industry</li>
<li>Much better engine performance, ~20% better Isp than N2O for our chamber pressure and expansion ratio
<ul>
<li>Also higher Isp for the same combustion temperature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as our fuel selection goes, we decided on the alcohols isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very similar performance to other hydrocarbons like kerosene</li>
<li>Both IPA and ethanol have lower freezing points than kerosene, less risk of freezing near cryogenic fluid system</li>
<li>Both are very cheap and easy to source, IPA slightly moreso but very slightly lower performance</li>
</ul>
<p>The pressurant was decided to be nitrogen due to cost</p>
<ul>
<li>N2
<ul>
<li>Cheap</li>
<li>Slightly worse performing than helium</li>
<li>Could potentially condense in a lox tank, this can be mitigated by diffusers and minimizing turbulence and mixing in the tankj</li>
<li>Lower gamma so less joule thompson cooling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He
<ul>
<li>~5x more expensive than N2</li>
<li>Helium has much higher kinematic viscosity, so much lower reynolds number -&gt; less pressure losses</li>
<li>Lower density, so less pressurant mass needed to fill the same amount of volume</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="injector">Injector<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#injector">#</a></h5>
<p>Significant guidance for design of the injector was provided by RPE9 and Huzel &amp; Huang. A like-unlike impinging injector was chosen for simplicity of design, manufacturability, and performance. Since this engine uses liquid injection, an incompressible discharge coefficient flow equation was used to calculate required injection area for the fuel and oxidizer, which is then used to find the number and size of orifices (the size of orifices was chosen to be compatible with available tooling).
</p>
$$
\dot{m} = Q\rho = C_d A \sqrt{2\rho \Delta P}
$$<p>
The impingement distance is a relevant parameter but not a major design consideration. Instead of focusing on a precise value, it should be chosen to be as close to the injector face as heat transfer, mixing efficiency and manufacturing permit.</p>
<h5 id="combustion-chamber">Combustion Chamber<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#combustion-chamber">#</a></h5>
<p>The combustion chamber size is best characterized by the parameter characteristic chamber length \(L^*\). Defined as the ratio of chamber volume to nozzle throat area, \(L^*\) specifies the propellant stay time in the combustion chamber. While \(L^*\) increases the characteristic performance of a combustion chamber up to a certain point (as the propellant has more time to react completely), beyond this, larger values lead to higher chamber volume and weight, increased cooling surface area, and greater friction losses. In industry, optimization analysis is required to determine the minimum \(L^*\) for efficient combustion, with experimental firings used to validate this under specific conditions. An estimate from existing experimental data can be a good approximate value however, and can be obtained from Huzel &amp; Huang based on the chosen propellant combination.</p>
<h5 id="nozzle">Nozzle<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nozzle">#</a></h5>
<p>The purpose of the nozzle is to extract enthalpy from the combustion products and turn it into kinetic energy. An ideally expanded nozzle will accelerate the products to sonic at the throat, and accelerate supersonically until the nozzle exit pressure matches atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>The nozzle geometry was constructed using a Rao parabolic approximation which approximates an ideal nozzle shape. The length of this nozzle is based off of the percent length of a full bell nozzle, and an 80% length nozzle results in over 98% ideal efficiency. Rao then provides a function for the contour of the nozzle which can be modeled in CAD and machined using a CNC lathe.</p>
<p>The thickness of the nozzle was determined first by estimating a value suitable for the pressures experienced, then thickened in high-heat flux areas such as the converging section and throat.</p>
<h5 id="tca-sealing">TCA Sealing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tca-sealing">#</a></h5>
<ul>
<li>PTFE o-rings used to seal between LOX and IPA manifold grooves</li>
<li>FKM o-rings used to seal between IPA manifold groove and atmosphere</li>
<li>Graphite pipe gaskets (cut to size with waterjet) used to seal between injector face and combustion chamber
<ul>
<li>High temperature requirement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bolt pretension selected to maintain adequate sealing force for o-rings and gasket while running</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fluid-system">Fluid System<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fluid-system">#</a></h4>
<h5 id="tanks">Tanks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tanks">#</a></h5>
<p>Initially, our design for the tank was modeled off of HalfCat Rocketry&rsquo;s Sphinx rocket, using saturated nitrous oxide as the oxidizer, which autogeneously pressurizes itself, and through the use of a stacked piston tank, the fuel (isopropyl alcohol) as well.</p>
<p>This design as some flaws however. Since cavitating venturis are not used in N2O systems (since it would immediately cavitate which is dangerous in nitrous), the flow is not very decoupled from the combustion chamber. This is not necessarily an issue, but combined with the fact that N2O-IPA combustion in the Sphinx design is very unstable (verified c* efficiencies of ~70%), this means that the very stiff injector (over 50%) is absolutely necessary to maintain semi-stable combustion, and may not adequately decouple instability that could excite a natural frequency of the feedline and piston tank (which could be particularly susceptible since the floating piston is coupled to propellant pressures).</p>
<p>For these and several other reasons, we decided to change our oxidizer to cryogenic liquid oxygen, and instead use a separate nitrogen pressurant tank to pressurize the independent LOX and IPA tanks.</p>

<li>Forgot to put zero thrust tees on vent valves - venting can be a lot of thrust!</li>
<li>Tubing for PTs should be as small as possible to minimize volume, 1/8&quot; or something. Can still have length to prevent cryo temps</li>
<li>Need faster acting valves, 1s is too slow</li>
<li>Purge line needs an orifice to be lower pressure for ox side since purging during startup; don&rsquo;t want to stop lox flow</li>
